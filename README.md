pinescript sample code for analysis
ChatGPT gives a great start for pinescript code, but some issues —
• Struggles with syntax, helps to specifically tell it to use v4 or v5 pinescript syntax 
• Functions and loop syntax get botched frequently
• GPT likes to reference pinescript functions that don’t exist
